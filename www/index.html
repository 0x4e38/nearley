            <p><strong>Parsers</strong> turn strings of characters into meaningful data structures (like a JSON object!). <strong>nearley</strong> is a <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>robust</strong>, and <strong>modern</strong> parser generator for JavaScript. You'll love it because:
            
            <ul>
                <li>It is the first JS parser to use the <strong>Earley</strong> algorithm (insert your own &lsquo;early bird&rsquo; pun here). It lives happily in <strong>node</strong>, but doesn't mind the <strong>browser</strong>.
                <li>It processes <strong>left recursion</strong> without choking. In fact, nearley will parse anything you throw at it without complaining or going into a <s>sulk</s> infinite loop.
                <li>It handles <strong>ambiguous grammars</strong> gracefully. Ambiguous grammars can be parsed in multiple ways: instead of getting confused, nearley gives you all the parsings (in a deterministic order!).
                <li>It allows for debugging with generous <strong>error detection</strong>.
                <li>It is powerful enough to be <strong>bootstrapped</strong>. That means nearley uses nearley to compile parts of nearley. nearleyception.
            </ul>
