Nearley test.
=============
Tests operate on the grammar p -> "(" p ")" | [a-z]
An input of size n is 2n+1 characters long, and of the form (((...a...))).

Running time tests.
-------------------
Each star corresponds to the time taken to parse an input of that size with a recursive grammar.

Running memory tests.
-------------------
Each star corresponds to the memory taken to parse an input of that size with a recursive grammar.
Occasional outliers may be caused by gc runs. Nearley profiling doesn't explicitly call the gc before each run.
